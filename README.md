## Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) template for FPGAs

### Sequential Monte Carlo

The Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method is a simulation-based approach to compute posterior distributions.
SMC methods often work well on applications considered intractable by other methods due to high dimensionality, but they are computationally demanding.

### Target platform

Maxeler 

### Example

1. Robot localisation
